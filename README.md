# OfflineMoodleDownloader
OfflineMoodleDownloader is a small Java Application that automaticly downloads all files of a Moodle account to a specific location.

## Goals
This is one of my small projects, however, my main goals are:
- Support multiple Moodle domains
- Setup Moodle files location
- Successfully Login
- Set a refresh timer
- Custom CSS

## Contributing
This project is being developed in Java 1.8 with JavaFX, so you'll need to have those installed.
After that feel free to take any pull requests or anything in the goal list.
